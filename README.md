# Adv-Inversion
Repository for the official implementation of our paper "Adv-Inversion: Stealthy Adversarial Attacks via GAN-Inversion for Facial Privacy Protection"


This repository contains the official implementation of Adv-Inversion, a novel framework for generating identity-preserving adversarial face samples via GAN inversion, designed to enhance facial privacy protection against unauthorized recognition systems.
